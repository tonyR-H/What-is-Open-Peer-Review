Transforming Peer Review Bibliography

Introduction

The Transforming Peer Review Bibliography includes selected English-language articles that are useful in understanding significant transformations to the peer review process.

The peer review process is gradually changing. David Shotton's " The Five Stars of Online Journal ArticlesâA Framework for Article Evaluation " and Emily Ford's " Defining and Characterizing Open Peer Review: A Review of the Literature " provide good overviews of this broad topic. This bibliography is concerned with major changes to peer review, such as open peer review (excluding just revealing the identity of traditional peer reviewers) and post-publication review. Here's Shotton's definition of open peer review:

    The whole review process is entirely transparent. Each submitted manuscript is immediately made available on the journal's website. Reviews and comments from readers are welcomed, and are considered alongside the formal peer reviews solicited from experts by the journal. All the reviews, the author's responses, and the original and final versions of the article are published, and the appointed reviewers and editors are acknowledged by name in the final version.

This is not a bibliography that treats open access in general or overlay journals.

This bibliography does not cover books, conference papers, digital media works (such as MP3 files), editorials (with one exception), e-mail messages, interviews, letters to the editor, presentation slides, technical reports, or transcripts, unpublished e-prints, or weblog postings.

Most sources have been published from January 2010 through December 2012; however, a limited number of earlier key sources are also included. The bibliography includes links to freely available versions of included works. If such versions are unavailable, italicized links to the publishers' descriptions are provided.

Such links, even to publisher versions and versions in disciplinary archives and institutional repositories, are subject to change. URLs may alter without warning (or automatic forwarding) or they may disappear altogether. Inclusion of links to works on authors' personal websites is highly selective. Note that e prints and published articles may not be identical.
